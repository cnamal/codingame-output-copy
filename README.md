# codingame-output-copy
Little userscript to be able to copy the output (console output) of a test case in [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com).

Adds a little Copy button at the bottom of Codingame's IDE menu.

## Notes

* Tested on Google Chrome using Tampermonkey.
* Works with the black IDE

## Known bugs

* On a screen with a bad resolution (like mine) the Friends button and the Copy button might overlap. At that point, the Copy button is the only clickable button. (But as geeks, we don't have any friends so it doesn't really matter...)
